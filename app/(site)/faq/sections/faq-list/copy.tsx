      question:
        "How does Subsights integrate with my existing website and tools?",
      answer:
        'Integration is seamless and designed to be lightweight. The AI can be added to your site with a simple no-code embed, and it works with your existing tools and workflows in several powerful ways:\n\nLead & Support Routing: We can route hot leads directly to your CRM (like HubSpot) or send instant email notifications to any team member. The chatbot is also time-aware, meaning it can provide a direct phone number to connect visitors with a live agent during your specified business hours.\n\nDynamic Data Sources: We can connect to live, public event calendars. This allows the AI to answer time-sensitive questions from visitors—like "what\'s happening next week?"—using the most up-to-date information, just like we do for Visit Sun Valley.\n\nAutomated Reporting: Stay on top of performance without logging in. We can send customized daily or monthly reports with key stats directly to your inbox.',

        "What platforms does Subsights work with? Can I add it to my Shopify / WordPress site?",
      answer:
        "Yes, absolutely. Our AI chatbot is designed to work on virtually any website platform that allows you to add a custom code snippet. This includes popular platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Squarespace, and many more.\n\nInstallation is incredibly simple. You just copy a two-line script from your Subsights dashboard and paste it into your website's code. Once you do, the chatbot widget will appear.\n\nIn rare cases, a website's custom CSS or existing code might affect the chatbot's initial formatting. This is usually a quick fix, and our team is always on standby to work directly with you or your developer to ensure everything looks and works perfectly.",

        "Yes. Our AI is designed to be multilingual. It automatically detects the language a visitor is using and responds in that same language. Even if your website and knowledge base are entirely in English, the chatbot can seamlessly communicate with users in Spanish, French, German, and many other languages, allowing you to effectively engage a global audience.",

      question:
        "How does Subsights compare to other chatbot providers like Intercom?",
      answer:
        'While there are many chat tools available, Subsights was built differently from the ground up with a modern, AI-first approach. Many platforms are legacy systems that have added AI as a feature.

Instead of giving you a generic tool that requires immense effort to be useful, we provide a managed, personalized service. We excel at refining the complex behaviors needed to create a true expert assistant for your website, saving you the work.\n\nTransparent & Cost-Effective Pricing: You get the power of an enterprise-grade AI without the punishing costs. Our pricing is straightforward and designed to provide a clear ROI, free from the complex, legacy pricing models of many larger providers.\n\nA Modern, Faster Platform: Our entire system is built to be beautiful, fast, and intuitive. You get a seamless experience without the weight of a clunky, legacy interface.\n\nPersonalized & Responsive Support: As a focused company, your success is our top priority. You get direct access to our expert team, ensuring you receive the responsive, high-touch service needed to achieve your goals.\n\nIn short, we\'re here to disrupt the chat business by providing a more intelligent, cost-effective, and beautifully designed solution with the personalized support to ensure it succeeds.',

        "Yes, absolutely. We make it simple to ensure your AI assistant perfectly matches your brand's look and feel.\n\nFrom the \"Appearance\" tab in your Subsights app, you have full control over the visual design. You can:\n\nUpload Your Logo: Your logo will be used as the chat icon on your site and within the chat window itself.\n\nCustomize All Colors: Easily adjust the colors of the header, buttons, backgrounds, and text to seamlessly blend with your website's design.\n\nSet the Chatbot's Name: You can give your AI assistant a custom name that aligns with your brand's voice.\n\nBeyond the visual appearance, the chatbot's \"personality\" is shaped by the custom behaviors and nuanced answers we help you build, ensuring it acts as a true, on-brand extension of your team.",

      question: "Do you have an API for developers?",
      answer:
        "Currently, we do not offer a public, self-serve API for general use. Our platform is designed to be a powerful, fully-managed solution that is easily embedded on your website with a simple code snippet.\n\nWhile API keys are generated within our app for your chatbot instance, direct API access for custom development—such as integrating our chat functionality into a different application—is considered an enterprise-level feature. For clients on our Enterprise plan with specific needs, we can explore creating custom API endpoints as part of a tailored solution.\n\nIf you have a specific, large-scale project in mind that would require API access, please contact our team to discuss your requirements.",

You can even set rules, like excluding content published before a certain date, to keep your knowledge base perfectly relevant.\n\nQ&A Pairs: For critical information, you can manually add specific questions and answers to ensure your AI responds with the exact wording you want, every time.\n\nText Sources: You can add free-form text under specific topics directly in the app. This is perfect for product details, company policies, or other key information that might not be on your website.\n\nFile Uploads: We natively support .pdf, .txt, and .md files, with plans to add support for more types soon.\n\nOur goal is to work with the content you have. If you have a file type that isn't natively supported yet, simply email it to our team at support@subsights.com. We will manually process it and add it to your knowledge base for you.\n\nFor more advanced needs, such as connecting to live data streams or other internal systems, we can develop custom data integrations. This is a powerful capability that is typically part of our Enterprise plan and allows us to build a truly bespoke AI solution for your business.",

      answer:
        "We ensure accuracy through a robust, multi-layered process that combines automated testing with our hands-on managed service:\n\nInitial Testing & Onboarding: Before your chatbot goes live, our team leads an extensive testing process. We simulate hundreds of unique, industry-specific conversations to identify any gaps in the knowledge base and fine-tune the AI's behaviors. Our goal is to ensure it's at least 98% accurate from day one.\n\nContinuous Refinement: We know that real-world user questions can be unpredictable. Our system is designed for continuous improvement. The daily and monthly reports we provide include links to conversation summaries, allowing you to instantly flag any incorrect answer and add a comment.\n\nManaged Service: Our team actively monitors performance and uses your feedback to continuously refine the chatbot's knowledge and behaviors. This ensures the AI becomes an even more accurate and valuable asset over time.\n\nWhile we can't promise 100% perfection due to the unpredictable nature of user queries, our streamlined process guarantees that any issues are identified and corrected quickly, ensuring a consistently reliable and high-quality experience for your visitors.",
