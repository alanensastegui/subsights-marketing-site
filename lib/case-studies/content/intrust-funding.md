# How Intrust Funding Filters Noise & Drives High-Quality Leads with Subsights AI

- **Dramatically Increased Sales Efficiency**
- **Higher Quality Lead Generation**
- **24/7 Automated Lead Filtering**

See how a specialized lender automated their lead qualification process to eliminate noise, save countless hours for their sales team, and engage exclusively with high-intent investors.

## The Challenge: A Niche Lender Attracting a Broad Audience

For a specialized lender like Intrust Funding—which focuses on hard money loans for real estate investors exclusively in Washington State—a strong online presence is a double-edged sword. While it attracts a high volume of traffic, it also brings a significant number of inquiries from users whose needs fall outside this narrow focus.

The core challenge was to manage this high volume of "noise" 24/7. Without an effective filter, the sales team would spend countless hours sifting through unqualified inquiries, leading to lost productivity and potentially missing high-quality leads buried in the influx.

## The Solution: An AI-Powered Lead Qualification & Filtering Engine

Intrust Funding deployed a sophisticated AI assistant, "Penny," powered by the Subsights platform to act as an intelligent front door. Penny was designed to be more than a simple FAQ bot; she functions as a robust, 24/7 lead qualification and filtering engine. By embedding deep, deterministic business logic directly into her operational instructions, Penny can navigate complex conversations and execute the company's business strategy with precision.

Analysis of real user conversations demonstrates Penny's ability to:

- **Instantly Filter Out-of-Scope Inquiries:** Penny immediately identifies and politely deflects requests for personal loans, grants, or social housing.
- **Qualify Leads Based on Niche Criteria:** She effectively screens inquiries based on Intrust Funding's core business model, asking clarifying questions about location (WA State only), asset type, and loan purpose.
- **Engage and Convert Qualified Investors:** Once a user is identified as a potential fit, Penny seamlessly transitions into a sales-oriented role, providing specific loan terms and capturing contact information.
- **Handle Complex, Investor-Specific Questions:** Penny confidently answers detailed questions about advanced topics like the Gator Method and DSCR loans, establishing credibility.

## The Subsights Difference: Key Logic for Success

Penny's success is rooted in a purpose-built architecture that executes specific, hard-coded business rules to replicate the decision-making process of an expert loan officer.

1. **The Foundation:** A Custom-Built Knowledge Base  
   Our process begins by using the client's entire website sitemap as the foundation for the AI's knowledge. We then enrich this with custom business logic and nuanced behaviors to handle their specific operational needs. Through continuous monitoring of real conversations, we work with the client to constantly refine the AI, ensuring it becomes a smarter, more effective asset for their team over time.

2. **An Interactive Qualification Funnel:**  
   Instead of a static form, Subsights creates a dynamic, conversational experience for website visitors. Prospects can ask questions like "Do I qualify?" and get instant, accurate answers based on the business's specific criteria. Once a lead is qualified, the handoff is seamless. The AI is time-aware and can connect the visitor to a live agent via phone during business hours or capture their information for immediate follow-up. This data flows directly into the client's CRM and is visible in the Subsights app, creating a powerful, automated system that doesn't require the team to manage yet another tool.

3. **Context-Aware, Nuanced Responses:**  
   Penny demonstrates an ability to understand user context beyond surface-level questions, from reassuring nervous borrowers about low credit scores to accurately explaining complex financing strategies.

## The Impact: Measurable Business Results

By implementing an AI assistant on the Subsights platform, Intrust Funding has successfully automated its front-line lead qualification process.

- **Dramatically Increased Sales Efficiency:** By automatically filtering out the vast majority of unqualified inquiries, Penny ensures the sales team spends their time exclusively on high-potential, relevant leads.
- **Higher Quality Lead Generation:** The AI assistant effectively identifies and engages serious real estate investors 24/7, capturing contact information and warming up leads before they ever speak to a human.
- **Enhanced Brand Clarity:** Penny consistently educates users on Intrust Funding's niche, reinforcing the company's brand as a specialized lender for WA real estate investors.
- **Improved Customer Experience:** Even users who are not a fit receive a prompt, professional, and genuinely helpful interaction, protecting the company's reputation.
