See how Subsights’ AI assistant helps Allied Health Schools guide users through complex choices to effectively drive revenue & generate high-quality leads.

## The Challenge: A 24/7 Global Customer Base & Complex Inquiries

Tour operators like Dylan's Tours serve a global audience, meaning customer inquiries about logistics, tour details, and availability come in at all hours. Handling this volume instantly while also managing complex booking questions, custom requests, and strategic discounts requires significant staff time and can lead to missed opportunities if not handled promptly.

## The Solution: An Intelligent AI Assistant on the Subsights Platform

Dylan's Tours deployed an AI assistant powered by the Subsights platform to act as a front-line team member. The AI assistant capably handles a wide spectrum of user needs, including:

- **Instant Answers to Common Questions:** The AI instantly resolves the most frequent inquiries—parking, hotel pickups, tour inclusions, and cancellation policies—freeing up human staff.
- **24/7 Global Engagement:** With inquiries coming from the UK, Australia, the Philippines, and across the US, the AI provides immediate, accurate support in any time zone.
- **Strategic Upselling:** When users inquire about tours not on the standard menu (like trips to Carmel), the AI intelligently pivots to suggest and provide information for high-value "Custom Private Tours," turning a simple question into a significant sales opportunity.
- **Complex Logistical Guidance:** The AI doesn't just give simple answers; it helps users plan. It explains variables for combining tours and empowers customers to check live calendars, setting clear expectations.

## The Subsights Difference: Key Logic for Success

The success of the Dylan's Tours assistant comes from our unique, managed approach that goes far beyond basic AI.

1. **A Hybrid Knowledge Base for Unmatched Precision:** We start by using the client's website sitemap as a foundation, capturing all the details about their tours, pricing, and inclusions. However, for a business with many similar offerings, a simple AI can easily get confused and provide incorrect information. To solve this, we add a managed layer of custom logic and nuanced behaviors. This ensures that when a visitor asks about a specific tour, they get the right answer, every time—a challenge where basic AI often fails.
2. **Lightweight Implementation, Powerful Performance:** Our platform is designed to deliver exceptional customer service without requiring complex or costly integrations. It works powerfully as a standalone tool, handling multilingual conversations and complex trip-planning questions seamlessly. This provides immense value right out of the box. And because our system is flexible, we have the capability to integrate with booking software and other tools if and when the need arises.
3. **Intelligent, Nuanced Business Logic:** Our platform is designed to execute complex business rules with precision, handling nuanced scenarios such as:
   - **Tiered & Strategic Discounting:** It executes a multi-level discount strategy, offering a standard code for general inquiries but a more valuable one only when specific conditions are met (e.g., user identifies as military).
   - **Proactive, Helpful Recommendations:** When asked about parking, it doesn't just say "it's limited." It provides a genuinely helpful, modern solution by recommending users reserve spots via SpotHero.com.

## The Impact: Increased Efficiency and a Better Customer Experience

By implementing an AI assistant on the Subsights platform, tour operators like Dylan's Tours can:

- **Dramatically Increase Efficiency** by automating responses to the majority of inbound inquiries.
- **Provide Instant, 24/7 Service** to a global customer base, improving satisfaction and capturing leads that would otherwise be lost overnight.
- **Drive More Revenue** by intelligently upselling custom private tours and managing discount strategies.
- **Enhance the Customer Experience** by providing accurate, context-aware, and genuinely helpful information that helps users plan their perfect trip.
