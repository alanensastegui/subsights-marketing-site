Artificial intelligence has moved far beyond simple chatbots. Modern support organizations are using AI to analyze intent, predict satisfaction, and surface the next best action for agents. The result is faster resolutions and happier customers.

One major shift is the rise of proactive support. Instead of waiting for tickets to be filed, AI models can detect patterns that signal a problem and trigger outreach before users even realize there's an issue. This approach turns support into a value driver rather than a cost center.

AI is also changing the day-to-day experience of support agents. Tools like Subsights summarize lengthy conversations, suggest replies, and highlight relevant knowledge base articles. By offloading repetitive tasks, agents are free to focus on complex cases that require human judgement.

As algorithms become more capable, ethical considerations like data privacy and model bias become even more important. We'll continue to watch how the industry addresses these challenges and share what we learn along the way.
