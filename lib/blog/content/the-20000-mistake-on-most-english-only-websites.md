Imagine a potential customer from Switzerland is on your website, ready to book a week-long trip for their family—a sale worth thousands of dollars. They ask a simple question in German about your cancellation policy.

They get no answer. Your website, packed with valuable information, is effectively invisible to them.

Trust evaporates. The booking is abandoned. That's not just a failed translation; it's a lost sale. For most businesses, this isn't a hypothetical; it's happening every single day.

## The Impossible Alternatives: A Cost Breakdown

So how do you serve a global audience? Before now, you had two painful, expensive, and deeply flawed options.

### Alternative 1: The Full Website Translation Project

This seems like the most professional choice, but the cost is staggering, especially for a content-rich site like our partner, Visit Sun Valley, which has over 1,000 pages.

**Initial Translation**
According to industry data, professional translation and localization for a single language costs between $15 and $30 per page. For a site like Visit Sun Valley, translating into just one new language would be a $15,000 - $30,000 upfront project.

**Ongoing Maintenance**
That's not a one-time fee. With constantly changing events and content, you'd be looking at an ongoing retainer of $1,000 - $2,000+ per month to keep that single translated site up to date.

The math is brutal. And even after all that investment, you've only solved the problem for one language, and you still haven't provided the instant, conversational guidance your visitors actually want.

### Alternative 2: The "Google Translate" Workflow

The scrappier alternative is to have your team manually translate emails and messages. This doesn't just deliver a poor customer experience; it's a massive drain on your most valuable resource: your team's time.

A single support staff member spending just 5 hours a week on this slow, error-prone process costs your business over $10,000 a year in salary time—time that could be spent on high-value work.

## The Subsights Solution: Global Reach, Built-In
