excerpt: "Introducing the Subsights blog where we share updates, experiments, and lessons learned building AI for customer support."

Launching a product is the easy part; iterating in public is where the real work begins. We created the Subsights blog to document that journey and share the ideas that keep us up at night. Expect thoughtful essays, technical deep dives, and candid stories about what it takes to build useful AI.

## Why a Blog?

Most of our conversations with customers happen one-on-one. Those chats are invaluable, but they don't scale. A blog gives us a home for the patterns we see across teams, the experiments that succeed (and the ones that don't), and the product decisions that shape Subsights. If you're curious about how AI is changing support or just like peeking behind the curtain, you're in the right place.

## What We'll Cover

Our posts will range from high level strategy to low level implementation details:

- Feature announcements with context on the problems they solve.
- Best practices for weaving AI into existing workflows.
- Lessons learned shipping fast in a rapidly changing ecosystem.

We'll also invite customers and partners to contribute guest pieces. The goal is to create a library of practical knowledge for anyone building or operating AI‑powered support.

## Stay in Touch

We want this to be a conversation. Reach out on [social](https://www.linkedin.com/company/subsights/) or send us an [email](mailto:team@subsights.com). Let us know what you'd like to read about and how we can make Subsights more helpful for your customers.

Thanks for stopping by—we're just getting started.
