One of the most requested features from our beta users was a clear way to monitor how customers feel across every conversation. Today we're excited to release real-time sentiment dashboards for all Subsights accounts.

The dashboard aggregates signals from chat, email, and voice interactions and converts them into an easy to scan timeline. Managers can instantly spot negative trends, drill into specific conversations, and share insights with the broader team.

Behind the scenes, the feature is powered by our updated sentiment analysis pipeline which now runs on a streaming architecture. Each message is processed as it's received, enabling alerts within seconds when customer frustration rises.

We're just getting started with what real-time sentiment can unlock. Upcoming updates will include team-level benchmarks, historical comparisons, and the ability to export data directly into your CRM. Let us know how you’re using the new dashboard and what metrics you’d like to see next.
