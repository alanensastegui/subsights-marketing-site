In customer support, timing is everything. When sentiment sours, the gap between frustration and a public complaint can be a matter of minutes. Our new real-time sentiment dashboard is built to close that gap by monitoring conversations as they happen.

## From Transcript to Signal

Subsights ingests chat and ticket transcripts, then applies lightweight language models to score each interaction. Rather than wait for a conversation to end, we analyze messages as they arrive. The dashboard aggregates those scores into a single view of customer mood across channels.

The result is a live pulse of your support org. A sudden spike in negative sentiment alerts managers to jump in, while persistent positivity highlights what’s working.

## Built for Action

Charts are only useful if they lead to action. Each widget on the dashboard links back to the underlying conversations. Managers can filter by channel, tag, or agent, then jump directly into a thread to coach or resolve.

We also expose a webhook for teams that want to route signals into their own tooling—think Slack alerts or custom automations that trigger when sentiment dips below a threshold.

## What's Next

The dashboard is just the first step. We're experimenting with predictive models that forecast satisfaction scores before a conversation begins, and exploring ways to correlate sentiment trends with business metrics like retention and revenue.

If you'd like early access to these experiments or have feedback on the dashboard, drop us a line. We're building this in the open and would love your input.
