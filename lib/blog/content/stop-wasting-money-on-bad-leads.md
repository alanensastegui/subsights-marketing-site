The average B2B lead costs around $200. Your sales team's time costs even more. So why are we letting clumsy chatbots and clunky "contact us" forms waste both?

Every hour your team spends sifting through unqualified inquiries is an hour they aren't closing deals. This isn't just a process problem; it's a balance sheet problem.

The solution isn't a stricter gate. It's a smarter, more humane conversation. You need an [AI Teammate](/blog/the-expert-teammate) that acts as your best sales development rep - one that expertly screens for the right criteria, 24/7, without ever feeling like a robot.

### The Difference Between a Gatekeeper and an Expert

Most chatbots are built like gatekeepers. They force visitors through rigid forms and brittle yes/no questions, killing the conversation before it can begin.

A great AI Teammate acts like an expert guide. It understands that the best qualification happens inside a helpful, natural conversation. It knows what to ask, when to ask it, and how to route the outcome, so visitors feel helped and your team sees fewer, better leads.

Here's what that actually looks like.

#### Field Notes: The Expert Screener at [Intrust Funding](/case-studies/intrust-funding)

[Intrust Funding](/case-studies/intrust-funding) is a private lender focused on real estate investors in Washington state. For them, humane qualification comes down to two decisive questions: is the deal in Washington, and is it a loan type they actually offer? Their AI Teammate is engineered to get these answers seamlessly.

-   Visitor: "Hi, I'm interested in your bridge loans. What are your rates?"

-   AI Teammate: "Of course. To get you the most accurate rates, could you tell me which state the property is in?"

-   Visitor: "It's in Oregon."

-   AI Teammate: "Thanks for clarifying. Currently, we only lend on investor deals in Washington State. While we can't help with this project, we have some great partners in Oregon we can recommend."

The result: The visitor gets a clear, respectful answer. Your sales team's time is protected for real opportunities. No one feels like they just got "disqualified" by a robot.

### How It Works: A Playbook, Not Just a Prompt

This level of intelligent qualification isn't about writing a 10-page prompt. It's about having a platform that's engineered to think like a member of your team.

The Subsights [AI Teammate](/features) combines two key pieces:

1.  Your Business Playbook: We codify your non-negotiables—service areas, pricing rules, qualification criteria—powered by a structured [Knowledge Base](/features/knowledge-base). These are the clear boundaries that align every response with the way you run your business.

2.  A Reasoning Engine: Behind the scenes, a team of specialized AI agents interprets messy, human questions and selects the right play from your playbook—our [Dual-Query workflow](/blog/two-tracks-one-outcome-dual-query-workflows) ensures helpful answers and the next best action in the same turn. It's not generic chatter; it's the disciplined execution of your strategy.

Best of all, you manage it through simple, conversational feedback with our streamlined [Setup & Onboarding](/features/setup-onboarding). You don't need to be a prompt engineer to tell your teammate, "If a lead isn't in our service area, recommend our partners."

Stop letting bad leads drain your resources. It's time to [add an expert to your team](/email-my-demo) that delivers a pipeline of high-quality, sales-ready opportunities.
