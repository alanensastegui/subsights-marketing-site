*Notes on why rules + LLMs beat legacy chatbots when outcomes matter—and how Subsights puts that into practice.*

---

### The paradox  
Legacy chatbots promised automation and delivered flowcharts. Ask slightly off-script and they send you to a link farm.  

Pure LLM chat flipped the script—fluent, flexible, impressive in demos—but inconsistent when the stakes are real.  

So we’re stuck between rigidity and drift. We need both reliability **and** depth. That’s the gap Subsights was built to close.

---

### Between the lines  
Customers rarely name their true intent. They don’t say, “I need a tiered package that handles a late arrival and dietary restrictions.”  

They ask, “We land at 11pm—what can we do?”  

FAQ bots repeat facts. An Expert Teammate listens for what’s unsaid, interprets the constraint, and moves the person forward.  

Subsights is designed for that kind of listening—grounded in your content and policies, but flexible enough to handle the messy, human way people ask.

---

### The Expert Teammate  
Think of it as two halves working together:  
- **Rules**: your eligibility, pricing, policies, escalation paths, brand voice.  
- **LLMs**: reasoning through messy questions, adapting tone, handling multi-turn threads, multilingual by default.  

Subsights pairs these on day one. Together, they act like a colleague who knows your playbook cold and can still improvise—confidently, within guardrails.

---

### Why scale breaks intuition  
Small teams stay close to customers by default. Founders answer emails. Support spots patterns. Everyone shares the same gut feel.  

Scale scatters signal across tickets, chats, and DMs. Context fragments. Decisions drift.  

Subsights restores closeness at scale—qualifying, guiding, and escalating with context in the loop, not buried under it. Teams get fewer “what’s the policy?” pings and more “this is ready to book/buy” moments.

---

### Contrast that matters  
Legacy FAQ bots are rigid: they expect perfect phrasing and collapse outside the script.  

Generic AI chat is fluid: it charms in a sandbox and wobbles in production.  

The Subsights Expert Teammate is different: it anchors every answer in your rules while using LLMs to interpret nuance. It doesn’t just reply—it recommends the **next step** and follows through.

It’s the difference between:  
- **Reacting** to a question vs. **interpreting** intent.  
- **Repeating** information vs. **moving** someone forward.  
- **Sounding** helpful vs. **converting**.

### Proof in outcomes  
- A **tour operator** runs 24/7 with an Expert Teammate that interprets complex travel questions, proposes the right itinerary, and upsells private tours. Staff focus on high-touch logistics instead of “What’s included?” loops.  
- A **lender** screens prospects using niche criteria before they ever reach sales, redirecting time to qualified applicants instead of mismatched leads.  
- An **education provider** turns late-night student questions into qualified pipeline—context captured, follow-ups precise, nothing lost in the inbox.  

These aren’t one-off scripts—they’re repeatable systems Subsights helps you stand up quickly and refine over time.

### How it works in practice  
1) **Ground truth**: we ingest your real sources of truth so answers are precise, not generic.  
2) **Business rules**: we codify eligibility, pricing, incentives, and escalation so they’re applied consistently.  
3) **Orchestration**: we separate “find the facts” from “say it well” to reduce drift across multi-turn conversations.  
4) **Outcomes**: every helpful answer ends with a clear next action—book, buy, compare, talk to sales.  
5) **Handoff**: when humans step in, the full conversation and context come with them.

Subsights handles the heavy lifting—setup, tuning, and ongoing optimization—so your team doesn’t have to babysit another tool.

---

### What’s next  
We’re rolling out page-aware guidance that adapts to what someone is actually viewing—trimming fluff and shortening the path to action.  

And because not every problem should be solved by AI, Subsights makes handoff feel like a relay, not a reset—fast, contextual, and on-brand.

---

### The takeaway  
FAQ bots react. Generic AI improvises. The Subsights Expert Teammate does the harder, more valuable thing: it listens between the lines, applies your rules, and drives outcomes.  

If you’re serious about turning support into a revenue engine, don’t ship another chatbot. **Build your Expert Teammate with Subsights.**
