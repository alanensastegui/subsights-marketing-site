*A practical guide on why most AI chatbots fail and how to build one that actually drives business outcomes.*

## The Three Flawed Choices in AI Chat
If you’re a business leader adding AI to your website, you’re usually offered three unsatisfying paths. Each solves a symptom while creating a new problem.

**Option 1: The Rigid Flowchart Bot.**  
The phone-tree of chat. Predictable — until it isn’t. One unexpected phrasing and the experience collapses into loops, dead ends, or “I don’t understand.” Reliability without range. Escalations that should never happen.

**Option 2: The “Pure” LLM Bot.**  
Fluent in demos, fragile in production. Without your policies, pricing, or constraints, it invents answers. We’ve all seen the lowlights — the $1 car quote, the poetry slam against the brand. Impressive language, absent judgment.

**Option 3: The “Brittle” Custom Bot.**  
Looks tailored, feels like bespoke debt. Built on heavyweight platforms, it ships as a black box. Simple changes require a statement of work. The model isn’t the bottleneck — the developer pipeline is.

These choices force a false tradeoff: reliable but useless, impressive but untrustworthy, or custom but costly to maintain.

## The Fourth Way: An Expert Teammate
There’s a better approach: strong guardrails informed by real context.

The Subsights Expert Teammate combines two opinionated pieces:

1. **Your Business Playbook.**  
   We codify the non-negotiables — pricing tiers, shipping rules, qualification criteria. Clear boundaries that align every response with the way you run the business. See how [All Allied Health Schools](https://www.subsights.com/case-studies/all-allied-health-schools) uses this approach to qualify leads.

2. **The AI's Reasoning Engine.**  
   A small team of specialized agents interprets messy, human questions and selects the right play. Not generic chatter — disciplined execution of your playbook, conversation by conversation. See how [Dylan's Tours](https://www.subsights.com/case-studies/dylans-tours) uses this approach to handle complex travel inquiries and drive revenue through strategic upselling.

Vision with constraints. Flexibility without drift.

## How This Approach Delivers an Expert
The interface is a simple chat. The system behind it is a workflow.

Instead of one giant model guessing, specialist AI agents work in sequence with clear ownership. Each step is observable, testable, and easy to adjust. That’s why it’s reliable on day one and adaptable on day two.

This creates a tight improvement loop:

- **Audit Every Conversation.**  
  Receive concise summaries that surface wins, misses, and patterns.

- **Improve with a Click.**  
  Spot something off? Jump straight to the transcript, flag it, and specify the desired behavior.

- **Refine the Playbook.**  
  Your feedback becomes new rules and better routing. One-off issues turn into permanent fixes.

## The Result: Reliable Scalability and Satisfied Customers
Turn AI into an operational system that keeps you close to customer reality.

We launch with the right constraints, then make incremental changes visible and fast. Reporting and conversation auditing keep you in control, so you see how your input becomes better outcomes. As volume grows, quality holds — not by chance, but by design.

## The Takeaway
Flowchart bots react. Generic AI improvises. Brittle custom builds ossify.
