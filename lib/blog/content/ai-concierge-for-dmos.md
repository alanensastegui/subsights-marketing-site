Visitors don’t arrive with perfect itineraries. They arrive with half-formed plans, a few screenshots, and weather that might change tomorrow. Your job is to help them decide, quickly and confidently. Software can do a lot here. The trick is making it feel local.

We’ve been building AI concierges for destinations and partners. This is what we’ve learned.

## **Start with the place**

The most trustworthy answers sound like they come from someone who lives there. Not from a model reciting a brochure. So we anchor the concierge in your place: neighborhoods, seasons, closures, buses that never quite show, the café that opens early on marathon day.

A good test: if a local reads an answer and nods, you’re close. If they squint, you’re not.

## **Form before flourish**

Chat looks simple. It isn’t. Unbounded text gives visitors infinite ways to ask for help, and infinite opportunities to drift. We add form through context and a multi-agent architecture—a quiet division of labor where small specialists help compose the reply. The goal isn’t to constrain; it’s to set the banks of the river so the current actually moves.

Soon, we’re adding viewport awareness. The concierge can peek at what’s on the visitor’s screen—the headline they’re reading, the section they’ve scrolled to, the labels on the page—and fold that into its answer. It means fewer generic replies and more “I see you’re on Getting Around; here’s tonight’s tram schedule and the last service notice.” It also means we don’t repeat what the page already says; we build on it.

Interfaces that respect context beat clever prompts. Knowing you’re on the Museum Pass page changes the first sentence. Knowing you’re halfway down a closures list changes the follow-up. The conversation feels less like a reset and more like continuity.

## **Answers that move**

A correct answer is the bare minimum. A useful answer moves someone forward.

Every reply should end with a next step that matters: open the family itinerary, check pass eligibility, book the early ferry. When visitors are planning, they want momentum. When they’re in destination, they want directions, times, and the one detail that saves a headache.

If an answer doesn’t nudge a decision, it’s unfinished.

## **Confidence as a feature**

Great concierges know when they don’t know. We show our work: the source, the timestamp, the caveat. If confidence drops—storm alerts, permit rules, medical questions—it asks once to clarify and then offers a human. Not because we fear being wrong, but because trust is fragile and worth protecting.

Refusals can be graceful. “I can’t give visa advice, but here’s the official page.” That’s still help.

## **The local economy matters**

A destination is an ecosystem, not just a funnel. The concierge should route attention to partners fairly and transparently. Official passes get first billing. Offers are relevant, not pushy. We don’t undercut operators; we amplify them.

Ethics aren’t a checkbox; they’re the product.

## **Seasonal truth**

Destinations breathe. The “right” answer in July is wrong in January. We treat seasonality as data, not decoration. Feeds for events and alerts. Knowledge that knows when the gondola runs or the road closes. The concierge should feel like someone who knows what week it is.

## **Naturally multilingual**

People plan in their own words. The concierge picks up the visitor’s language and replies in it—no settings, no flags.

[81% of people in the world do not speak English](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/world/#people-and-society). The bar is simple: a visitor’s experience shouldn’t be worse because they don’t speak English. The concierge can speak dozens.

## **Handoff that earns goodwill**

There are moments when a human is faster: complex refunds, group bookings, accessibility requests. The switch should feel like a single conversation, not a restart. We pass the transcript. We don’t ask the same questions twice.

If you’ve ever been handed from one phone tree to another, you know why this matters.

## **Guardrails that guide, not choke**

Rules make the system feel calm. We define what the concierge can say, what it must cite, and what it must hand off. We log the dynamic facts behind sensitive claims. We don’t train on your visitors’ conversations. We keep accessibility in mind so anyone can use it, on any device, at any speed.

The point of guardrails isn’t to make the system smaller. It’s to make it reliable.

## **What good feels like**

A visitor asks about two rainy days with kids. The concierge suggests the science museum before nap time, a city pass that actually saves money for that itinerary, and a tram ride if the clouds break. It links to the right page, shows the hours, notes the bus frequency, and offers to save the route offline. If the museum is sold out, it says so and offers a plan B that isn’t a tourist trap.

It feels like help from someone who lives there. That’s the bar.

We’re building this kind of concierge with destination teams every week. If you want one that feels local, respects your partners, and proves its impact, we’d love to help.
