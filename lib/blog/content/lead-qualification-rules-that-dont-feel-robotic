Qualification is where many website assistants go wrong. Rules get bolted on as afterthoughts—checkboxes, brittle forms, and generic refusals—until the experience feels like a gate, not a guide. Sales teams end up with the worst of both worlds: too many unqualified conversations and a first touch that puts good prospects off.

We built [Subsights’ qualification](https://subsights.com) as a **designed system**: workflows with context and governance. The distinction matters—explicit **What → Action** steps, thresholds, and refusals make decisions explainable and consistent. It combines retrieval, ranking, and workflow reasoning to decide what to ask, when to ask it, and how to route the outcome—so visitors feel helped and your team sees fewer, better leads. Here’s how we approached it.

## What humane qualification looks like
Our goal wasn’t to make a stricter gate. It was to make **clear, respectful decisions** in-context:

- **Scope before screening.** Say what you *can* do first, then the boundary.  
- **Conversation instead of forms.** Ask only what’s required, only when needed.  
- **Time-aware routing.** Connect live during business hours; capture and commit after hours.  
- **Explain the why.** When declining, give the rationale in a single sentence.  
- **No pitch without fit.** Handoffs and offers wait until there’s a confirmed match.

Small interaction choices, compounding into a very different first impression.

---

## Better retrieval + explicit rules
The system starts by assembling the best available context—policy, product/offer constraints, location rules, and recent content—then applies **deterministic checks** (e.g., geo and eligibility) alongside **ranked intents** from the conversation. That candidate set feeds a reasoning step that decides:

1) Do we have enough signal to continue the funnel?  
2) If yes, what is the *next* most respectful question to ask?  
3) If qualified, which next action is most useful (share terms, schedule, collect contact, or escalate)?  
4) If out of scope, what’s the clearest way to say no and exit?

Early versions that relied on small, tightly scoped prompts did fine on simple cases but struggled when a crucial detail was missing or implied. Moving to a [workflow-first](https://subsights.com/blog/how-to-write-prompts-that-actually-work), agentic approach let the assistant pull the right snippets, apply rules consistently, and make decisions that match how a senior rep handles nuance—without improvisation.

---

## Designing for reasoning—without losing speed
Reasoning takes steps. We designed the experience around two principles:

- **Responsiveness that doesn’t bluff.** If the system doesn’t have enough signal, it asks a short, purposeful question rather than guessing. If nothing meets the bar for an offer or handoff, nothing is shown.  
- **Visible guardrails.** Boundaries and refusals are explicit and consistent. When we collect contact details or route to a human, we say why and what happens next.

The result is a flow that feels fast and considerate—even when it’s doing more work under the hood than a static form.

## Field notes: Intrust Funding
[Intrust Funding](https://subsights.com/case-studies/intrust-funding) is a private lender focused on Washington-state real-estate investors. For them, humane qualification boiled down to **two decisive gates**:

1) **Location:** *Is this person’s deal in Washington?*  
2) **Loan type:** *Are they looking for a kind of loan Intrust actually offers?*

The funnel reflects that priority:

- If **WA + supported loan type** → share terms, collect contact, and—during business hours—offer a live handoff.  
- If **either gate fails** → decline clearly (“We lend to Washington State investor deals only” or “We don’t offer that loan type”), then exit without friction—no loops, no forced capture.

Everything else is in service of those two checks: short questions, crisp rationale, and clean routing. The experience feels like a knowledgeable rep who knows exactly what to ask—and when to stop.

## The workflow behind the tone
We organize qualification as explicit **[What → Action](https://subsights.com/blog/how-to-write-prompts-that-actually-work)** steps so the assistant stays predictable and on-brand:

- **What:** “Can you finance my property?”  
  **Action:** Ask for **state**; if WA, ask for **loan type**. If both fit, show terms and ask for contact; otherwise, decline with a one-line rationale.

- **What:** “Do I qualify?”  
  **Action:** Resolve the biggest uncertainty first (usually state). If fit is confirmed and it’s business hours, offer to connect now; otherwise capture and route.

This workflow is written in plain language, versioned, and maintained for you. It’s the difference between “an AI that tries things” and **[a teammate with a playbook](https://subsights.com/blog/the-expert-teammate)**.

*(The same workflow discipline also powers **[dual-track designs](https://subsights.com/case-studies/all-allied-health-schools)** in other verticals, where the assistant resolves a question and surfaces the next best action in the same turn.)*

## Operational discipline (what we handle)
To keep qualification humane and consistent over time, we manage the operating details:

- Mission and boundaries written up front (help first, then route).  
- Offer and policy catalogs (eligibility, seasonality, priority).  
- Refusal and escalation language that’s short, steady, and on brand.  
- Thresholds for when to recommend, when to fallback, and when to connect live.  
- Weekly review of conversation summaries to close gaps and adjust rules.

You don’t need to wire any of this. We build and maintain it with you.

---

## Visibility into outcomes
Instead of opaque scores, you get **daily conversation summaries** (intent, outcome, assistant response) and **monthly aggregates** (most common intents, frequent user locations, trending topics). The aim is transparency: you see what the assistant is doing, which decisions it made, and where demand is shifting—without reverse-engineering a dashboard.

---

## Where this matters most
Sales-led businesses—lenders, B2B services, high-consideration products—win or lose on qualification. When the first touch is clear and considerate, two good things happen:

- Your team talks to more of the right people.  
- The people you turn away leave with a clean answer and an intact impression of your brand.

---

## What’s next
As we widen the context the assistant can draw from—more precise policy, richer offers, fresher content—we’ll introduce **opt-in automation** for the steps you already trust (e.g., attach terms after fit, route to a specific queue). Control remains with you; transparency remains the rule.
